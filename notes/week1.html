        <h2>First Principles AGI Dinner Notes</h2>
        <div class="dinner-date">Week 1 - May 2025</div>
        
        <h3>Key Themes Discussed</h3>
        
        <h4>AGI Capabilities and Representation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What does AGI enable?
                <ul>
                    <li>Infinite conversations with something that has infinite knowledge</li>
                    <li>Important subtlety: tacit knowledge (LLMs don't know what Bob's pizza store made yesterday, or how I helped a squirrel today etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For LLMs or DNA models, there is a unit of information. A smallest relevant unit:
                <ul>
                    <li>For LLMs, it's a letter or a word</li>
                    <li>For DNA, it's a nucleotide</li>
                    <li>The relationships between these units hold meaning (a word's meaning is represented by other words)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What is the equivalent for physical reality? A box's meaning is not necessarily represented by other boxes</li>
            <li>We have not yet figured out the right data representation of physical reality</li>
            <li>What are the domains for which we do not yet have the correct data representations?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Diffusion Models and Physics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Beautiful explanation of diffusion models: there are things for which entropy increase is easy; the hard thing is to go backwards</li>
            <li>As you add heat to a system, entropy increases - it gets more chaotic</li>
            <li>It's extremely hard to run this process in reverse, but with some set of rules, we *can* work backwards</li>
            <li>This lets us reach an interesting state with perhaps novel properties (representing a different state from which we could have come)</li>
            <li>Loop concept: physics making biology making humans understanding physics</li>
            <li>TTT - test time training</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Architecture and Representation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Question: Why are all architects drawing on paper?</li>
            <li>They show sketches of the outside of a house, but lack of digitally represented architecture prevents modeling things like weather (e.g., the puddle example)</li>
            <li>Side note: This also means limited training data for architecture foundation models</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>CAD and Physical Modeling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>CAD happens in the space of user intuition, relying heavily on context that sits in the user's imagination</li>
            <li>"If I have to write out all 672 dimensions, I might as well just CAD the whole thing"</li>
            <li>Counter: couldn't you compress the number of dimensions you have to write out in your language?</li>
            <li>Point: you can't tokenize operations like extrude</li>
            <li>Counter: In code, the word "for" signals a loop operation. Why can't you say the same thing in the CAD case?</li>
            <li>Question about assembly code</li>
            <li>Response: Models are trained on the high-level language - they're trained on the abstracted data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Automation and Future Jobs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>High frequency, low variance tasks are already solved (e.g., assembly line doing *exact* same thing)</li>
            <li>High frequency, high variance is more interesting and currently harder to automate (e.g., pick and place worker using different components with different geometries)</li>
            <li>Concern about education, language learning and employability</li>
            <li>English proficiency = social status + employability</li>
            <li>Question: By the time we have sufficiently good voice language learning apps, won't jobs like call centers have been replaced?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Text vs. Physical Reality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Something interesting about text: its very nature demands recording it - because we read it online, it must be stored for reading</li>
            <li>Physical reality is experienced in the real world - so its "data" is mostly stored in the real world and not online</li>
            <li>Thought exercise: What is an efficient way to store data about physical objects?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Model Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do we need a fundamentally new model architecture?</li>
            <li>Model architecture for physical reality is still a very active area of research</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Future Ideas</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Train a CAD model as an autocomplete</li>
            <li>Use the user's prior history of "CAD history timelines" to suggest a next edit from their current position</li>
        </ul>
